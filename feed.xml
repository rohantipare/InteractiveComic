&lt;p&gt;Hi There, Sorry- I haven’t posted in 2 weeks &amp;amp; that tells me even a WFH person like me needs to go out &amp;amp; there is some good news on that front. So lets start,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VR is ideal for those who work in the #construction industry &amp;amp; #Trezi is a platform made right here in #India for the world- &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3aWVPxi&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for ideas &amp;amp; products on #AR &amp;amp; VR then you must follow #ProductHunt - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2KPXTwB&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can a professional sportsman use #VR to keep up with his game in a lock-down? well #Rezzil thinks so- &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/35rx9My&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello World,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier post I had written how every bit of technology should be used to beat COVID-19 &amp;amp; the XR community is doing its bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel robbed, while I was stuck with my idea for a social distancing app , #Snap INC has gone ahead &amp;amp; created one - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/34s6dM9&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #XR community is taking on COVID-19, 17K doctors are using VR in this fight - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3eexQN7&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyper-casual games continue to find audiences &amp;amp; prove they are here to stay, tell me if these 3 games are fun - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3b1NCsP&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lock-downs means everyone has a home office now, #VR is aiding these #Ford designers to inspect cars too - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/34vOfIk&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the scene has begun to evolve for consumer #AR in India, If you are a Bollywood fan, you might want to try this one out- &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3b2Vc6o&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you plan to use AR/VR tech this year ??? Let me show you effective ways to begin with AR/VR . Check out this link - &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2tzyCll&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay home - Stay safe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do constraints help people generate new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us are finding it difficult to make this transition. We are forced to use unknown, untested methods &amp;amp; practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not wired for something like COVID19 before &amp;amp; now our mindset has to grapple with questions with no easy answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit heading a animation/game school so I could get into game development. I took a mini sabbatical &amp;amp; my first action on the third day at home was to write answers to questions on Quora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s empowering to help others, to share what you know. Being productive with your expertise is taking away space from negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gained perspective on many thoughts that had earlier eluded me. I discovered new ways &amp;amp; tools to improve my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then out of the blue, I was Quora top writer for 2018 &amp;amp; it all made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that summer I started giving swimming lessons to kids in my society . It helped me think over my plans as I took to the pool after the kids were done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in our working lives we have  time on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote work is not easy &amp;amp; it takes time to adjust to these sudden changes in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So give yourself the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer is raising valid questions amidst all the hype &amp;amp; euphoria surrounding the growing demand of #XR / #AR / #VR solutions from companies &amp;amp; businesses .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have no doubts on the viability of XR in the long term but I sure don’t want to get carried away by the growing noise  in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a serious life threatening situation, but its not a permanent one. It has unified the world like never before &amp;amp; its a matter of time before things will be put under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no other way to do it, even though the virus seems to have an upper hand for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to normal will be the most important achievement for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens to all the hurried investments made by XR community &amp;amp; businesses they serve, once life goes back to normal .&lt;/p&gt;

I have posted earlier iterations twice before. With this version we are nearing the finish line &amp;amp; then we go to testing with 3D artists. This was the drill last time too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artist who is helping out with the test, is an experienced 3d hand with good #texturing skills. Up till now its the #programmer :-) who was painting the textures in Gimp. We also hope to test with non-BEAR animals &amp;amp; human models too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to 3d character artists, if you would like to contribute character model for the test, we would be happy to use it &amp;amp; share the results with that artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE- The model will still be yours &amp;amp; will not be added to our #showreel. We will share the results &amp;amp; you can decide if it can be displayed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appreciate it if some of  the #3d #characters #artists who struggle with creating 3d-Hair or Fur in their work, could throw in their comments or a word of advise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#ArtSpecial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world around has changed &amp;amp; I don’t know how life will enfold from now on. Both work &amp;amp; the current events have kept me from posting this newsletter for two weeks. So i am resuming from where I had left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#bringArtToLive  is the moto of this #AR app platform, so show the world how good your AR artwork is-  &lt;a href=&quot;https://artivive.com/&quot;&gt;https://artivive.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s Art then you have Art curators, but times have changed, because now we also have AR art curation apps &amp;amp; tech platforms to give your work the much needed love- &lt;a href=&quot;https://eyejackapp.com/&quot;&gt;https://eyejackapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a deluge of content on how the use of various technologies will help people engage with others &amp;amp; maintain a social distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify at the onset. I wouldn’t mind tons of work coming my way because people want to interact with the world using digital aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely mind if people are forced to need some technology for no fault of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where’s the win-win here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology should not be seen as cold &amp;amp; unsympathetic, because it is not.  No doubts, every bit of technology must be used to beat this situation. But for now I don’t want to shove it in anyone’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some technologies will help some people, but not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And its so obvious, the world was not ready with a ‘real’ solution or technology- before we got hit by a pandemic of global proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reports, of people losing jobs, because companies cant afford to keep employees at home. You cant manufacture a sock, grow vegetables or repair gas pipelines from your homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no expert, but this is neither 2008, 9/11 or like some past epidemic. What it is &amp;amp; what will be its aftermath we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we beat it, we sure can, for this too shall pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added configurable multiple segments for each fur strand, so that they can bend. Each fur strand is made up of more than one particles (vertices) , so now each can be simulated independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earlier iteration the fur strand was just a triangle, with fixed base and only its tip could be simulated. Now the fur strand (triangle) is subdivided and more than one of its vertices can be simulated so they can bend much more realistically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#Update-17March&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has helped us get better in some niche areas of 3d programming in Unity &amp;amp; Unreal. Lets see how it has helped us with other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A- With the 3d cloth fitting ( Kinect based Virtual Mirror) on a dynamic 3d avatar was where the mesh level programming concepts learnt before in Unity helped take it to another level Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B- On the 2nd version of the fur tool (Video Above) we have moved away from base mesh manipulation to developing shader system that operate at the GPU level.&lt;/p&gt;
